# 🧠 NeuroNexus – UA Student Experience Enhancer

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/YOUR_BADGE_ID/deploy-status)](https://neuronexus.netlify.app)

> A smart, centralized student platform to simplify life at the University of Arizona 🎓

---

## 💡 Inspiration
At the University of Arizona, student life is fragmented — different apps for courses, separate portals for parking, confusing pantry lines, and no smart planner in sight. As students ourselves, we envisioned a **centralized, AI-powered hub** that could unify and simplify our campus experience.

That vision became **NeuroNexus**.

---

## 🚀 What It Does
NeuroNexus is a smart campus platform designed to make life easier for UA students. It includes:

- 🧑‍🏫 D2L-inspired dashboard (course cards + announcements)
- 📚 Smart Study Assistant (AI-generated weekly plans)
- 🌍 Multilingual UI support (English & Spanish)
- 🅿️ UA Parking Lot availability simulator
- 🚌 Campus bus viewer (CatTran + SunTran routes)
- 🥫 Pantry queue optimizer (smart wait-time system)
- 🗺️ Interactive cultural club map with filters + join animations 🎉
- 📅 Weekly planner + assignment checklist
- 🤝 Mentor matching based on student interests

## 🔧 How We Built It

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **UI**: TailwindCSS, Chart.js
- **Localization**: `react-i18next` for dynamic language switching
- **AI Logic**: Local inference via Ollama (`gemma:2b`)
- **Hosting**: [Netlify](https://neuronexus.netlify.app)
- **Structure**: Modular component-based layout using React Router
